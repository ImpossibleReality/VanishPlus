# Vanish (but improved)
VanishPlus is a WIP highly configurable advanced vanish plugin.
**THIS PLUGIN IS CURRENTLY IN BETA, I _HIGHLY_ recommend using the [OFFICIAL](https://github.com/123456687548/vanish) plugin while I am developing**
It's used to mask your online status, so no one knows that you are online.

It stops the server from sending specific packets to other players that notify their client that you exist on this server.

# Features:
- Invisible (The game of the other players don't get any information of your presence)
- No hacked Client can see you
- In Server list fake amount of players online
- Not showing up in the playerlist
- You make no sound, except while destroying blocks
- Fake join/leave message
- Overwrites /list command, so it doesn't show vanished players
- Overwrites /msg command, so you cannot be messaged by other players
- Settings file

# TODO:
Add invisible and incognito vanish modes
Add configuration for extra modes
Display status of the plugin by hotbar (and config for that)
Make autocompletion not show "Your vanished" message
Allow permission group to be able to detect vanished players.
